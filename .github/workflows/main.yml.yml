# This file contains the essential steps for getting the app packaged and scanned using Veracode's various
# scan types.  We suggest starting with the elements in this file and fully understanding them before
# attempting more advanced use cases, like 'Pipeline scan on a PR', or importing Issues.

# The essential steps shown below are:
#   checkout and package the app for scanning
#   upload for a static scan
#   run the SCA agent scan
#   run the Container scan
